Quick start
===========

HandBrake takes videos you already have and makes new ones that work on your mobile phone, tablet, TV media player, game console, computer, or web browserâ€”nearly anything that supports modern video formats.

This quick start guide assumes you have already downloaded and installed HandBrake. If you do not already have HandBrake, please see [Downloading and installing HandBrake](../get-handbrake/download-and-install.html).

Let's get started.

## Launch HandBrake

Launch HandBrake by quickly clicking twice (double-clicking) on the cocktail & pineapple icon. Depending on your system settings, a single click may suffice.

## Open your existing video

HandBrake calls the video you already have the `Source`.

Select the `Open Source` button on the toolbar to browse your files for a video to open. You may also drag your `Source` video onto HandBrake's main window. 

<!-- .system-linux -->

<!-- TODO: Linux figures. -->

<!-- /.system-linux -->
<!-- .system-macos -->

<!-- /.system-macos -->
<!-- .system-windows -->

<!-- TODO: Windows figures. -->

<!-- /.system-windows -->

## Select a title

Some `Sources` may contain more than one video clip, or a collection of `Titles`. Use HandBrake's `Title` control to select which video clip you want to use.

<!-- .system-linux -->

<!-- TODO: Linux figures. -->

<!-- /.system-linux -->
<!-- .system-macos -->

<!-- /.system-macos -->
<!-- .system-windows -->

<!-- TODO: Windows figures. -->

<!-- /.system-windows -->

Some `Sources` have only one `Title`. Blu-ray and DVD `Sources` often have multiple `Titles`.

## Select a preset

HandBrake provides a number of settings `Presets` to make your new video work well with your playback devices and software. For instance, if you have a Playstation 4, you may wish to select the `Playstation 1080p30 Surround` preset under `Devices`.

The default `Fast 1080p30` preset is often a good choice because it's fast and compatible with most devices.

<!-- /.system-linux -->
<!-- .system-macos -->

![Selecting a preset](../../images/mac/preset-selection-1.1.0.png "Presets are one-click settings to save you time and help ensure compatibility with your devices.")

<!-- /.system-macos -->
<!-- .system-windows -->

<!-- TODO: Windows figures. -->

<!-- /.system-windows -->

`Presets` can affect compatibility (whether your video will work with your devices and software) and encoding time. Learn more about [Selecting a preset](../workflow/select-preset.html).

## Select a destination

HandBrake calls the file name and location of your new video the `Destination`.

`Save As` is the file name of your new video. You can change it by typing directly in the box.

`To` is the location where HandBrake will place your new video. You can select the `Browse...` button to choose a different location.

<!-- .system-linux -->

<!-- TODO: Linux figures. -->

<!-- /.system-linux -->
<!-- .system-macos -->

![Selecting a destination](../../images/mac/destination-field-1.1.0.png "The Destination is where HandBrake will place your new video.")

<!-- /.system-macos -->
<!-- .system-windows -->

<!-- TODO: Windows figures. -->

<!-- /.system-windows -->

Please take special care to *note your destination*. Otherwise, you won't be able to find your new video. You can move it later if you desire.

## Start the encode

Select the `Start` button on the toolbar to make your new video.

<!-- .system-linux -->

<!-- TODO: Linux figures. -->

<!-- /.system-linux -->
<!-- .system-macos -->

![Encode progress](../../images/mac/encode-progress-1.1.0.png "HandBrake reports its progress during encoding.")

![Encoding complete alert](../../images/mac/encode-complete-1.1.0.png "HandBrake shows a notification when finished encoding.")

<!-- /.system-macos -->

HandBrake will report its progress while it's working and alert you when it's finished. Then you will have a new video file at the `Destination` you specified.

<!-- .system-macos -->

![Destination in Finder](../../images/mac/destination-finder-1.1.0.png "Your new video is located at the Destination you specified.")

<!-- /.system-macos -->
<!-- .system-windows -->

<!-- TODO: Windows figures. -->

<!-- /.system-windows -->

Congratulations! You just encoded your first video using HandBrake. It's now ready to watch on your devices.
