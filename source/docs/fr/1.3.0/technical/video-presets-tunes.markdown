Encoder Presets and Tunes
==========================

Presets
--------------

Some encoders expose a preset and tune system. These can be adjusted from the Video Tab.

These provide a means of adjusting the encoder parameters to trade encoding speed for better quality and / or filesize.
Changes to the preset may also require changes to the quality slider or bitrate for optimium results. 

Specific encoder settings can be overridden via the "Extra Options" box but this is typically not required.

Best practice is to use a preset around the middle. in 

Tunes
--------------

The x264 and x265 tune options assign some additional options which will optimize the
encoder for certain types of content.

If you are unsure or your content doesn't really fit into one of the following
tunes, you can simply leave this option at "None".
