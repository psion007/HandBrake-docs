Source Angles
=============================

Some videos or movies have "multiple angles". This is where the same scene is shot from different camera angles.

HandBrake can read multiple video tracks from DVD and BluRay sources.

Under the source section, you will see a dropdown with the label "Angle" if your source type supports it.
You can choose which angle to encode to your output file.
HandBrake does not currently support multi-angle output.
