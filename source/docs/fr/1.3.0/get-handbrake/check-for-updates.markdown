Checking for updates
====================

HandBrake can let you know when a newer version is available, and even automatically download and install available updates.

Before updating, please make sure there are no pending encodes in the `Queue`. If you are currently using HandBrake older than version 1.0.0, also make note of any custom `Presets` you have created, as they may not be compatible with newer versions.

<!-- .system-linux -->

## Updating HandBrake on Linux

The Linux version of HandBrake does not have a built-in update checking feature. Your Linux distribution's package manager will handle any updates to the official PPA.

<!-- /.system-linux -->
<!-- .system-macos -->

## Updating HandBrake on Mac

After you've installed and launched HandBrake more than once, it will ask whether you want to automatically check for updates. Select `Check Automatically` and HandBrake will offer to install future updates as they become available.

![Automatic updates dialog](../../images/mac/check-for-updates-automatically-1.1.0.png "Checking for updates automatically can help you stay up to date with the latest features and bug fixes.")

Automatic update checking may be enabled or disabled in HandBrake's preferences. Using the main menu at the top of your screen, select `HandBrake` and then `Preferences...`. You will find the option in the `General` section.

Manually checking for updates is easy. Using the main menu at the top of your screen, select `HandBrake` and then `Check for Updates...`. If an update is available, HandBrake will offer to install it for you.

![Software update dialog](../../images/mac/software-update-1.1.0.png "If an update is available, HandBrake will offer to install it for you.")

<!-- /.system-macos -->
<!-- .system-windows -->

## Updating HandBrake on Windows

Automatic update checking may be enabled or disabled in HandBrake's preferences. From the `Tools` menu select `Preferences`. You will find the option in the `General` section. HandBrake will alert you when a new update is available.

Manually checking for updates is easy. From the `Help` menu, select `Check for Updates...`. If an update is available, HandBrake will offer to install it for you.
