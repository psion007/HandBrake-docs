Contributing
============

HandBrake is an open source project created and maintained by the HandBrake Team. All are welcome to contribute to the project, and contributions following these simple guidelines are more likely to be accepted.

## Conduct

First and foremost, familiarize yourself with the project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Community Forum Rules](https://forum.handbrake.fr/app.php/rules). The HandBrake Team expects all contributors to conduct themselves accordingly.

## Communication

Please ask the HandBrake Team via one of the [Community Support](../help/community-support.html) channels before adding major features or making other broad changes.

*Failure to communicate what you are working on may lead to duplicated efforts or rejection of your contributions.*

## Ways to contribute

### User interface and graphics

HandBrake's user interface is constantly evolving. Special care and expertise are required to enhance usability while retaining and expanding its many professional features. Icons and other graphic assets are also needed from time to time, as user interface updates and modernization dictate.

The HandBrake Team welcomes contributions from user interface and graphic designers. Please introduce yourself via one of the [Community Support](../help/community-support.html) channels and someone will be glad to discuss what others are currently working on, your interests, and how you can help.

### Code

Developers wanting to contribute code should check out the [HandBrake source code on GitHub](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake) and a create pull request on GitHub for each contribution. For more on this workflow, read [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

[Open issues](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake/issues) are good candidates for learning and fixing various parts of the code base.

### Documentation

[HandBrake Documentation](https://handbrake.fr/docs/) is published on the official HandBrake website, and the [documentation source](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake-docs) is hosted on GitHub.

Please read the documentation project's [Contributing](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.markdown) guide to get started.

### Translation

HandBrake is written and maintained in English, and translated into multiple international languages by a community of volunteers. The HandBrake Team is working on bringing full technical support for multiple languages to all supported platforms; in the meantime, you will likely find translations available for some platforms and not others.

To view and contribute translations of the user interface strings in HandBrake, visit [HandBrake on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/HandBrakeProject/public/).
